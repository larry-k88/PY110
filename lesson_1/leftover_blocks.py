Problem:    Write a program that takes an available number of blocks,
            uses them according to the rules below to build the tallest
            structure, and calculates the number of blocks remaining
            Input - integer, available blocks
            Output - integer, remaining blocks
            Explicit requirements:
                - No gaps between blocks
                - Blocks are cubes
                - Top layer is one block
                - A block in an upper layer must be supported by 4
                - A lower block can support more than one upper block

            Implicit requirements:
                - Number of blocks can only be positive
                - No blocks will return 0

Examples/Test Cases:    Edge cases (empty inputs, zero, exception handling)

Data Structure:     What best suits the problem (list, dictionary etc.)       

Algorithm:  

    Pseudocode
    Formal pseudocode
